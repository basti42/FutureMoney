tl;dr
Browser Extension that displays the crypto currency value next to euro prices on amazon.

To get more used to crypto currencies we should just be exposed to them more often. Therefore this browser extension
(currently only Firefox) finds appropiate prices on amazon and displays their crypto currency converted values next to them.
In this first version, the extension only supports IOTA (because IOTA is awesome). More crypto currencies are however 
planned to be included.
